\begin{abstract}
In this paper methods for assessing the a posteriori quality of Monte-Carlo simulations are introduced. We show that altering the rewards of simulated play-outs in Monte-Carlo Tree Search based on their assessed quality improves results in five different 2-player boardgames. For this we propose two enhancements, the Qualitative Bonus and the Relative Bonus. Where the former relies on a simple heuristic evaluation of the game's end-state, and the latter relies only on the number of moves made in the simulated play-out. Results show that these enhancements allow for performance improvements of up to 14\% in the game Cannon.
